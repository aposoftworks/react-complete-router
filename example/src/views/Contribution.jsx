            <p>I'm working on this project alone and I sadly can't spend a lot of time in it. I plan to open a patreon page or donation link, because my dream is to become a developer programmer that can work on incredible packages such as this, to make your life easier. We also welcome you to fork and make pull-requests, feel free to send suggestions!</p>
